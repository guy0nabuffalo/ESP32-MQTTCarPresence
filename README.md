Used ChatGPT to convert original code which is for 8266 to be used with an ESP32. I'm not a coder by any means, I simply used ChatGPT to convert the code to ESP32.
Original code for 8266 can be found at https://github.com/aderusha/MQTTCarPresence.
All credit goes to aderusha who created the original code for this awesome project.
I also used wifi keep alive code found on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpr7PwBE8_c. 
Credit for the wifi keep alive code goes to the OverEngineeredInOz YouTuber.
Code for wifi keep alived linked in the YouTube video found here https://github.com/OverEngineeredInOz/YouTube/blob/master/ESP32WifiReconnect/ESP32WifiReconnect.ino
